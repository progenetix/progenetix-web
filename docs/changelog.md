# Change Log

This page lists changes for the [Beacon+](http://beacon.progenetix.org/ui/)
implementation of the ["Beacon" genomics API](http://beacon-project.io), as well
as related updates for the [Progenetix](http://progenetix.org) front-end.

## 2024-11-02: Fix for missing TCGA analyses

During import of the TCGA non-CNV variants the "analysis" objects somehow got
lost although variants were imported correctly, leading to a missing association of
those variants w/ their samples during query result aggregation. Fixed for all
10007 samples by extracting the previously assigned `analysis_id` values together
with the `biosample_id` values from the variants and generating the missing analysis
objects. Now TCGA has working calls for "double hit" CNV + SNV events.


## 2024-09-10: Ongoing removal of samples from pure germline series

So far of the currently 145264 samples the Progenetix collection consisted of 
besides data from

* 112674 cancer samples (including primary tumors, recurrences and metastases)
* 5742 cancer cell line samples
* 26848 germline samples consisting of
    - germline references of tumor patients
    - 3201 reference profiles from the 1000 genomes project
    - samples from 58 "accidental" germline series (_i.e._ such being analyzed
      in automated download & processing and then being kept for comparative purposes)

We are now in the process of creating a new resource for the germline samples
which will become available in the near future under the [refcnv.org](https://refcnv.org)
address. While strengthening the focus of the Progenetix database this will provide
a new general resource for germline CNV data e.g. as reference for rare disease
applications.


## 2024-06-18 Switching ontology use for `individual.sex`

While we had previously used the PATO terms for `genotypic sex` (PATO:0020001 
or PATO:0020002) we have now recoded those to `"NCIT:C16576": "female" and "NCIT:C20197": "male"`
to stay in line with the Beacon v2 documentation examples (which will probably drive implementations).

```
  sex:
    label: Genotypic Sex
    infoText: |
      Genotypic sex of the individual.
    defaultValue: ""
    isHidden: true
    options:
      - value: ""
        label: "(no selection)"
      - value: NCIT:C16576
        label: female
      - value: NCIT:C20197
        label: male
```

## 2024-02-24 Adding `analysis_operation` to `analyses`

This new parameter with its (so far) values

* `"analysis_operation.id":"EDAM:operation_3961", "analysis_operation.label":"Copy number variation detection"`
* `"analysis_operation.id":"EDAM:operation_3227", "analysis_operation.label":"Variant Calling"`

... allows now the filtering of analyses based on the type of genomic profiling
performed.

## 2023-06-12: Some schema changes...

**Schema changes are now extensively tracked in [bycon.progenetix.org](http://bycon.progenetix.org)**

The latest changes of the database schemas involve e.g.:

* several field changes in biosamples, to align w/ main Beacon v2 default schema:
  - `sampledTissue` => `sampleOriginDetail`
  - `description` => `notes`
  - `timeOfCollection.age` => `collectionMoment`


## 2022-12-22: Various API fixes & extensions

* the `genespans` responses contain now a `cytobands` parameter (i.e. the cytogenetic mapping of the gene's locus)
* FIXED: the beacon response meta now has the standard `receivedRequestSummary.requestParameters`
instead of before `receivedRequestSummary.variantPars`


## 2022-01-17: Term-specific queries

<img src="/img/2022-01-17-includeDescendantTerms-ui.png" style="float: right; width: 222px; margin-top: -15px;" alt="includeDescendantTerms selector" />So far (and still as standard), any
selected filter will also include matches on its child terms; i.e. "NCIT:C3052 -
Digestive System Neoplasm" will include results from gastric, esophagus, colon
... cancer. Here we introduce a selector for the search panel to make use of the Beacon v2
filters `includeDescendantTerms` pragma, which can be set to _false_ if one only
wants to query for the term itself and exclude any child terms from the matching.

Please be aware that this can only be applied globally and will affect all filtering
terms used in a query. More information is available in the [Filtering Terms](beaconplus.md#filters-filters-filtering-terms) documentation.


## 2022-01-17: Introducing `variant_state` classes for CNVs

More information can be found in the [description of ontology use for CNVs](common/classifications-and-ontologies.md#genomic-variations-cnv-ontology).

## 2022-01-10: BUG FIX Frequency Maps

Pre-computed Progenetix CNV frequency histograms (e.g. for NCIT codes) are based
samples from all child terms; e.g. `NCIT:C3262` will display an overview of all
neoplasias, although no single case has this specific code.

However, there had been a bu when under specific circumstances (code has some
mapped samples and code has more samples in child terms) only the direct matches
were used to compute the frequencies although the full number of samples was indicated
in the plot legend. FIXED.
