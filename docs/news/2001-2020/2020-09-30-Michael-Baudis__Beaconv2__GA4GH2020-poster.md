Version 2 of the protocol is slated to provide fundamental changes, towards a Internet of Genomics foundational standard:
<!--more-->
* requests beyond genomic variants ("filters")
* payload responses, secured through open AAI
* aligning w/ GA4GH standards (Phenopackets, VRS, DUO...) through SchemaBlocks [{S}[B]](https://schemablocks.org)
* Working with international partners on deployment of advanced implementations
