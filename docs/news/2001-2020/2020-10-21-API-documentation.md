Following the launch of the updated Progenetix website (new interface, now much
more data with >130'000 samples...) and the recent introduction of the new
Python based [`bycon`](http://github.com/progenetix/bycon) API for [BeaconPlus](https://beaconplus.progenetix.org/) and [Progenetix Services](/doc/services/services.html)
we now also have some structured information for the different API options.
