In a new publication in the _Journal of Clinical Oncology_ CJ Heesterbeek, SM Aukema and 
the co-authors from the Dutch NIPT Consortium report about the incidence and diagnostic
significance of incidential detection om maternal copy number variations in a large
screening program aimed at detecting chromosomal imbalances in embryos, for a prediction
of developmental abnormalities.

> ResultsMalignancy suspicious-NIPT results were reported in 0.03% after genome-wide NIPT, and malignancies confirmed in 16 patients (16/48, 33.3%). Multiple chromosomal aberrations were seen in 23 of 48 patients with genome-wide NIPT, and a malignancy was confirmed in 16 patients (16/23, 69.6%).

> NIPT data showed recurrent gains and losses in primary mediastinal B-cell lymphomas and classic Hodgkin lymphomas.

The authors of the study made nice use of the [Progenetix](http;//progenetix.org) for
assembly and visualization of the detected CNVs (with some support from an hCNV community member :smile:).

Congratulations for the very nice paper, connecting genetics and cancer genomics in the CNV domain!
