With the November 2022 update we changed the file suffix to `pgxfreq` to keep a
clean separation between the (usually binned) CNV frequency files and the 
(usually raw) representation of sample-specific CNVs (and other variants).

The overall format hasn't changed from the previous implementation although
we intend to add representation for different CNV levels in future updates.
