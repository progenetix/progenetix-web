Inspired by some request regarding plotting of large sample numbers we've added
a [dedicated page](/plotting/) to this site as the one-stop place for plot generation
information (though you still will find examples e.g. on the [`use-cases`](/use-cases/) page).

!!! warn "Plot parameters lost the `-` prefix"

    We have removed the `-` prefix from the plot parameter names; e.g. the previous
    `-chr2plot` selector is now simply `chr2plot`.

Please file requests for additional parameters and/or documentation as [issue in the progenetix-web repository](https://github.com/progenetix/progenetix-web/issues).
