**Abstract**: Cancer cell lines are an important component in biological and medical research, enabling studies of cellular mechanisms as well as the development and testing of pharmaceuticals. Genomic alterations in cancer cell lines are widely studied as models for oncogenetic events and are represented in a wide range of primary resources. We have created a comprehensive, curated knowledge resource - cancercelllines.org - with the aim to enable easy access to genomic profiling data in cancer cell lines, curated from a variety of resources and integrating both copy number and single nucleotide variants (SNVs) data. We have gathered over 5,600 copy number profiles as well as SNV annotations for 16,000 cell lines and provide this data with mappings to the GRCh38 reference genome. Both genomic variations and associated curated metadata can be queried through the GA4GH Beacon v2 API and a graphical user interface with extensive data retrieval enabled using GA4GH data schemas under a permissive licensing scheme.

**Availability and Implementation**: Our resource is publicly available on the web at <https://cancercelllines.org>.
