![EFO copy number assessment tree](/img/EFO-CNV-tree.png){: style="float: right; width: 250px; margin-top: -15px;"}As part of the hCNV-X work - related to "Workflows and Tools for hCNV Data Exchange
Procedures" and to the intersection with Beacon and GA4GH VRS - we have now a [new
proposal](https://github.com/hcnv/hCNV-X/blob/main/docs/cnv-ontology-proposal.md)
for the creation of an ontology for the annotation of (relative) CNV events. The CNV 
representation ontology is targeted for adoption by Sequence Ontology (SO)
and then to be used by an updated version of the VRS standard. Please see the
discussions linked from the [proposal page](https://github.com/hcnv/hCNV-X/blob/main/docs/cnv-ontology-proposal.md).
However, we have also contributed the CNV proposal to EFO where it has gotten
live on January 21.

Everybody is welcome to contribute to the editing of the proposal at the SO & VRS Github repositories!

The `copy number assessment` term tree has been accepted into the Experimental Factor Ontology and can be used for referencing CNV types.
