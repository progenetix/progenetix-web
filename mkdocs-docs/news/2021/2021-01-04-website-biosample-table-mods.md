The new year brings some refinements to biosamples [search](http://progenetix.org/biosamples/) and display:

* added example for a pure filter search (HeLa)
* made UCSC link depending on variants
* added info pop-ups to biosamples table header
* removed _DEL_ and _DUP_ fractions from biosamples table
* added label display for `external_references` items in biosamples table

Enjoy ...
