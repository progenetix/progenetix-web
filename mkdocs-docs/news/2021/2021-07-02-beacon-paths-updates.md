For testing the rapidly evolving [Beacon v2](https://beacon-project.io/categories/beaconv2.html)
API, we have now implemented more paths/endpoints which mostly conform to the
brand new & still "flexible" v2.0.0-draft.4 version. Please check the
[documentation and examples](https://github.com/ga4gh-beacon/implementations-v2/blob/main/progenetix-examples.md).
