### [`Progenetixuse`](http://progenetix.org/publicationsProgenetixRef) Page

We have introduced a new publications listing page which contains links to articles
that [cite or use Progenetix](http://progenetix.org/publicationsProgenetixRef) and
resources from this "ecosystem." Please [let us know](mailto:contact@progenetix.org)
if you are aware of other such cases - frequently the publications do not use
a proper citation format but just refer to "according tho the Progenetix resource"
or similar in the text.

For proper citation please follow [the instructions](index.md) from the documentation home page.

### Improved Map

The pop-up in the Publication maps has been updated with a proper short text listing
and direct links to the article pages on EuropePMC.
