description: Excluding reference samples from default plots

So far all samples matching a grouping code ("collation"; disease, publication etc.)
have been included when generating the pre-computed CNV frequencies. However, the
potential inclusion of normal/refernce samples sometimes lead to "dampened" CNV
profiles. Now, samples labeled as "reference sample" ([`EFO:0009654`](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/EFO_0009654)) - 
a term we had introduced into the Experimental Factor Ontology - are excluded from
pre-computed histograms. However, when e.g. calling up samples from publications
using the search panel referencve samples will be included unless specifically excluded.
