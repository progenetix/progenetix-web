The Progenetix resource has finally been recognized as an official contribution to the ELIXIR European bioinformatics informatics ecosystem. Besides [Expasy](https://expasy.org) Progenetix now is linked through ELIXIR's resource page. Or just go directly to [progenetix.org](https://progenetix.org) (and its daughter project [cancercelllines.org](https://cancercelllines.org)).
