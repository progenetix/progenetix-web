#### Age (at diagnosis)

![age query image](/img/age-query.png){ width="280" style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 20px;" }
Here one (or two, for a range - see image) age values can be specified using
an ISO8601 period expression (e.g. `P3Y6M` or `P365D` - not including time elements)
prefixed by the `age` indicator, a `:` separator and one of the comparators
(`=`, `<=`, `>=`, `<`, `>`).

##### Examples

* `age:>=P18Y,age:<=P65Y`
* `age:<P1Y6M`

### Technical Fields

#### _Response Limit_ and _Skip Pages_

This functionality allows e.g. the limited retrieval of
a subset of samples from large or general cancer types, or the "paging" through consecutive
sample groups for partitioned data retrieval.

The **Response Limit** (API parameter `limit`) sets the maximum number of returned
samples, to change it from the internal default of 2000[^1]. Typical use cases here are
the speeding-up of data visualization by selecting a smaller subset (e.g. 200) for
large expected returns, or the successive paging through large result sets.

With **Skip Pages** (API parameter `skip`) - in combinations with a **Response Limit** - one can retrieve
different parts of a large response; e.g. `skip=2` with `limit=100` will return
samples **201-300**.

## Data Visualization

The [Data Visualization] button opens a new page where samples matched by the
query can be visualized for their aggregated and individual CNV profiles. This
includes creation & clustering of subsets (e.g. by shared pubmed, NCIT code ...)
as well as the visualization of clustered CNV sample plots. Optios include the
selection of individual chromosomes and the addition of labels (e.g. for selected
genes or custom markers).
