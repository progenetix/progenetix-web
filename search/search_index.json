The genomic profiling data was derived from genomic arrays and chromosomal Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH) as well as Whole Genome or Whole Exome Sequencing (WGS, WES) studies. Genomic profiles are either processed from various raw data formats or are extracted from published experimental results. Since 2024 the database also includes information on somatic sequence mutations in an increasing number of samples, e.g. for the TCGA datasets or cancer cell lines.</p> <p> cancercelllines.org is an information resource presenting known mutations from (as of 2025) more than  16000 cancer cell lines, additional to more than 5000 CNV profiles from cell line profiling experiments. arrayMap represents the subsetP of the Progenetix data for which probe-specific data from genomic array experiments is available.</p> <p>Tracking News</p> <p>For occasional news and messages - and to submit feedback - we suggest that you follow Progenetix on Mastodon @progenetix@genomic.social </p> <p>Citation</p> <ul> <li>Huang Q, Carrio-Cordo P, Gao B, Paloots R, Baudis M.

At the other end of the spectrum, in the area of rare disease genomics the potential pathogenicity of individual CNV events requires validation against a vast set of disease-related and reference genomic profiles and annotations.</p> <p>Methods The \u201cBeacon\u201d protocol - developed with support from ELIXIR, the European bioinformatics infrastructure organization, as a standard of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) - represents an emerging standard for an \u201cInternet for Genomics\u201d. While the initial version of the protocol served as a widely adopted test bed for the sharing of genomic variants over federated query systems connecting hundreds of internationally distributed resources, the version 2 of the protocol aims at providing a framework for extended, metadata-rich query and response options in both public and restricted federated access scenarios. Throughout the development of Beacon v2, the Progenetix cancer genomics resource (progenetix.org) - including the largest publicly accessible set of cancer CNV data - has served as a testbed for implementation of Beacon v2 protocol features. </p> <p>Results With the implementation of the Beacon v2 API as backbone of the Progenetix resource - serving genome-wide CNV profiling data from more than 130\u2019000 individual experiments, representing over 700 diagnostic entities and  more that 1\u2019500 published studies - we could demonstrate the use of the GA4GH Beacon v2 protocol as a practical solution for the sharing of vast amounts of genomic profiling data, in a open setting and using a documented, completely open API for third party use. Conclusion:</p> <p>With the Beacon v2 protocol - as a major upgrade from the v1 standard - currently being under review as GA4GH standard, work is focussing on its implementation in a wide set of use cases, from access protected clinical information systems to public-access research databases. Importantly, an ELIXIR-supported implementation study by members of the ELIXIR h-CNV community (cnvar.org) will explore the generation of Beacon v2 powered CNV implementations by various major European genomics resources, in the fields of human genetics / rare diseases and cancer genomics.</p> <p>Poster [PDF]</p> References <p>Huang, Q., Carrio-Cordo, P., Gao, B., Paloots, R., &amp; Baudis, M.

Genomic alterations in cancer cell lines are widely studied as models for oncogenetic events and are represented in a wide range of primary resources. We have created a comprehensive, curated knowledge resource - cancercelllines.org - with the aim to enable easy access to genomic profiling data in cancer cell lines, curated from a variety of resources and integrating both copy number and single nucleotide variants (SNVs) data. We have gathered over 5,600 copy number profiles as well as SNV annotations for 16,000 cell lines and provide this data with mappings to the GRCh38 reference genome. Both genomic variations and associated curated metadata can be queried through the GA4GH Beacon v2 API and a graphical user interface with extensive data retrieval enabled using GA4GH data schemas under a permissive licensing scheme.</p> <p>Availability and Implementation: Our resource is publicly available on the web at cancercelllines.org.</p>"},{"location":"news/2024-05-14-cancercelllines-in-SIB-Expasy/","title":"cancercelllines.org listed in Expasy","text":"<p> Our recently launched cancer cell line genomics site cancercelllines.org is now listed as one of the resources in the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics\u2019 Expasy catalogue. </p> <p>More information can be found in the article linked from our site.</p>"},{"location":"news/2024-07-02-high-level/","title":"Data model and plotting update","text":"<p>Both the data model and the plot engine now support an separate color style for high level CNV events.

METHODS: Of the 15429 cases collected for the Progenetix molecular-cytogenetic database, 5918 malignant epithelial neoplasias analyzed by chromosomal Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH) were selected for further evaluation. For the 22 clinico-pathological entities with more than 50 cases, summary profiles for genomic imbalances were generated from case specific data and analyzed.</p> <p>RESULTS: With large variation in overall genomic instability, recurring genomic gains and losses were prominent. Most entities showed frequent gains involving 8q2, while gains on 20q, 1q, 3q, 5p, 7q and 17q were frequent in different entities. Loss \"hot spots\" included 3p, 4q, 13q, 17p and 18q among others. Related average imbalance patterns were found for clinically distinct entities, e.g. hepatocellular carcinomas (ca.) and ductal breast ca., as well as for histologically related entities (squamous cell ca. of different sites). CONCLUSION: Although considerable case-by-case variation of genomic profiles can be found by CGH in epithelial malignancies, a limited set of variously combined chromosomal imbalances may be typical for carcinogenesis. Focus on the respective regions should aid in target gene detection and pathway deduction.</p>","tags":["article"]},{"location":"news/2001-2020/2012-04-02-compbio-arraymap-feature-updates/","title":"arrayMap feature update(s)","text":"","tags":["recovered","news","arraymap"]},{"location":"news/2001-2020/2012-04-02-compbio-arraymap-feature-updates/#arraymap-feature-updates","title":"arrayMap feature update(s)","text":"<p>Over the last weeks, we have introduced a number of new search/ordering features to arrayMap.

This could provide an alternative paradigm in cancer development, replacing the gradual accumulation of genomic changes with a \"one-off\" catastrophic event. However, the term has been used with varying operational definitions, with the minimal consensus being a large number of locally clustered copy number aberrations.</p> <p>The mechanisms underlying these chromothripsis-like patterns (CTLP) and their specific impact on tumorigenesis are still poorly understood. RESULTS: Here, we identified CTLP in 918 cancer samples, from a dataset of more than 22,000 oncogenomic arrays covering 132 cancer types. Fragmentation hotspots were found to be located on chromosome 8, 11, 12 and 17. Among the various cancer types, soft-tissue tumors exhibited particularly high CTLP frequencies. Genomic context analysis revealed that CTLP rearrangements frequently occurred in genomes that additionally harbored multiple copy number aberrations (CNAs). An investigation into the affected chromosomal regions showed a large proportion of arm-level pulverization and telomere related events, which would be compatible to a number of underlying mechanisms. We also report evidence that these genomic events may be correlated with patient age, stage and survival rate. CONCLUSIONS: Through a large-scale analysis of oncogenomic array data sets, this study characterized features associated with genomic aberrations patterns, compatible to the spectrum of \"chromothripsis\"-definitions as previously used. While quantifying clustered genomic copy number aberrations in cancer samples, our data indicates an underlying biological heterogeneity behind these chromothripsis-like patterns, beyond a well defined \"chromthripsis\" phenomenon.</p>","tags":["article"]},{"location":"news/2001-2020/2014-01-01-Progenetix-12-years/","title":"Progenetix: 12 years...","text":"","tags":["article"]},{"location":"news/2001-2020/2014-01-01-Progenetix-12-years/#progenetix-12-years-of-oncogenomic-data-curation","title":"Progenetix: 12 years of oncogenomic data curation.","text":"","tags":["article"]},{"location":"news/2001-2020/2014-01-01-Progenetix-12-years/#cai-h-kumar-n-ai-n-gupta-s-rath-p-baudis-m","title":"Cai H, Kumar N, Ai N, Gupta S, Rath P, Baudis M.","text":"<p>Abstract DNA copy number aberrations (CNAs) can be found in the majority of cancer genomes and are crucial for understanding the potential mechanisms underlying tumor initiation and progression.

During development of GA4GH metadata concepts and schemas - which have influenced emerging standards such as the Phenopackets format - cancer specific annotations from the Progenetix collection have served to identify conceptual requirements and to develop domain-specific mappings (e.g. ICD-O to NCIt translations). The resource's focus on structural genome variants has been instrumental in addressing their specific requirements in GA4GH schema development and the Beacon protocol.</p> <p>Here, we will demonstrate how an open genomic reference resource has been built around GA4GH standards and how it is being used to support ongoing and future developments in GA4GH standard development and ELIXIR implementation studies.</p> <p>progenetix.org</p>","tags":["poster","presentation","Beacon","GA4GH","about"]},{"location":"news/2001-2020/2020-09-30-Michael-Baudis__Progenetix-and-Beacon__GA4GH2020-poster/#additional-links","title":"Additional Links","text":"<ul> <li>Beacon Website</li> <li>Beacon+ in progenetix-next</li> <li>Bycon Project</li> </ul>","tags":["poster","presentation","Beacon","GA4GH","about"]},{"location":"news/2001-2020/2020-10-01-bycon-as-api/","title":"bycon powered BeaconPlus","text":"<p>We've changed the Beacon backend to the <code>bycon</code> code base.

To disentangle the molecular mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis as well as identify and characterize molecular subtypes, the comparative and meta-analysis of large genomic variant collections can be of immense importance. Over the last decades, cancer genomic profiling projects have resulted in a large amount of somatic genome variation profiles, however segregated in a multitude of individual studies and datasets. The Progenetix project, initiated in 2001, curates individual cancer CNA profiles and associated metadata from published oncogenomic studies and data repositories with the aim to empower integrative analyses spanning all different cancer biologies. During the last few years, the fields of genomics and cancer research have seen significant advancement in terms of molecular genetics technology, disease concepts, data standard harmonization as well as data availability, in an increasingly structured and systematic manner. For the Progenetix resource, continuous data integration, curation and maintenance have resulted in the most comprehensive representation of cancer genome CNA profiling data with 138 663 (including 115 357 tumor) copy number variation (CNV) profiles.
